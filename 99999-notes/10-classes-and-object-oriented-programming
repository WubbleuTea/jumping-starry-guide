WHAT'S OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

  Approch of planing and reasoning for your code
  Work with (real-life) Entities in your code (movie, ProductList, Person, shoppingCart, etc)

CLASSES AND INSTANCES

  OBJECTS
    "The things you work with in code."
    Instances of Classses (means based on classes)
  
  CLASSES
    "Blueprints for objects" (creates the objects, theoretical definition)
    Define how objects look like, which properties and methods they have
    Classes make creation of multiple similar objects much easier.

    CLASS-based creation is an alternative to using object literals!
