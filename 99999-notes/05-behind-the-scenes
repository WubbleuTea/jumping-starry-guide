ES5 VS ES6

ECMA script (ES)

ES5 (and older)
  Supported in basically all browser including old Internet Explorer
  Only had var for variables (not let and const)
  Generally uses the same syntax as ES6 but quite some missing features
ES6 (and newer,also known as ES2015)
  Supported in modern browser can mostly be transpiled to ES5
  Browsers automatically update.
  Many nre features that help us write cleaner, better and faster code.
  Still under active develoopment, but ES6 was a big step forward.
