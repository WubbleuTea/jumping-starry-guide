ES5 VS ES6

ECMA script (ES)

ES5 (and older)
  Supported in basically all browser including old Internet Explorer
  Only had var for variables (not let and const)
  Generally uses the same syntax as ES6 but quite some missing features
ES6 (and newer,also known as ES2015)
  Supported in modern browser can mostly be transpiled to ES5
  Browsers automatically update.
  Many nre features that help us write cleaner, better and faster code.
  Still under active develoopment, but ES6 was a big step forward.

JAVASCRIPT ENGINES AND WHAT THEY DO 

1. You write your code

2-A.Then the browser executes the script 
  JavaScript parsing and executes code (Interpreter and Compiler)
    Interpreter: load script, reads it, translates it to bytecode, then runs the script
    Compiler (JiT): turns bytecode from interpreter into machine code
      THESE HAPPEN SIDE BY SIDE

2-B. Browser APIs 
  Communication bridges between Javascript and (C++) logic built into the browser.

3. Then the compiled machine code goes to your computer
